## Featured Projects (Recent)

### 🎓 [Interactive Explainers](https://github.com/paraschopra/explainers) &nbsp; [![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue)](https://paraschopra.github.io/explainers/)
Interactive, visual explainers on topics like **diffusion models**, the **Fourier Transform**, **biological scaling laws**, **cellular automata**, and **how LLMs work**. Built for understanding through play.

### 🔬 [1D Cellular Automata Playground](https://github.com/paraschopra/1d-ca) &nbsp; [![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue)](https://paraschopra.github.io/1d-ca/)
An interactive exploration of all 256 elementary cellular automata rules. Visualize rule space structure, sweep initial conditions, and measure information propagation through spacetime.

### ⚕️ [LongShot](https://github.com/paraschopra/longshot) &nbsp; [![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-blue)](Live at: https://paraschopra.github.io/longshot/)
Get personalized screening recommendations for now and the future. Add them directly to your calendar.

### 🕹️ [Atari from Pixels](https://github.com/paraschopra/atari-pixels)
Training a neural network to play Atari games directly from raw pixel inputs using deep reinforcement learning.

### 🔍 [Logical Inconsistency Detector](https://github.com/paraschopra/logical-inconsistency-detector)
Detects logical contradictions in text using two approaches: embedding-based inconsistency vectors and LLM-as-Judge with topical clustering. Built with Sentence-BERT and GPT-4o-mini.

### 🔗 [CrossQuery Chrome Extension](https://github.com/paraschopra/crossquery-extension)
A browser extension that simultaneously searches on reddit, hacker news and other websites as you do Google searches.

## Old Projects

### 🎨 [Abstract Art Neural Network](https://github.com/paraschopra/abstract-art-neural-network)
Generating abstract art through neural networks in PyTorch. Feed in parameters, get unique art pieces out.

### 🧠 [One Network, Many Uses](https://github.com/paraschopra/one-network-many-uses)
A single deep network that does four things: image search, image captioning, finding similar words, and finding similar images. Exploring the power of shared representations.

### 🧬 [Deep Neuroevolution](https://github.com/paraschopra/deepneuroevolution)
Evolving deep neural network agents using Genetic Algorithms — no gradients required. A gradient-free approach to reinforcement learning.

### 📊 [Bayesian Neural Network on MNIST](https://github.com/paraschopra/bayesian-neural-network-mnist)
Bayesian neural network implementation using Pyro and PyTorch on the MNIST dataset. Quantifying uncertainty in neural network predictions.
